Echo Base
=========

Base project starter files.

This project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org) to preprocess and compile CSS. [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is used to monitor files and run compass, as well as concat and minify the javascript and enable the LiveReload browser plugin.

This is a great [Guard overview](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/guard-is-your-best-friend/) if you are not already familiar with it.
