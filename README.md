Echo Base
=========

Base project starter files.

This project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org) to preprocess and compile CSS. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is used to concat and minify javascript, as well as run all preprocessing tasks either directly or via the LiveReload browser plugin.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone this repo locally
2. CD to the project root
3. Run `bundle install` to install Sass and Compass dependencies (defined in Gemfile)
4. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies (defined in package.json)
5. Run `grunt watch` to start the watch task (defined in Gruntfile.js)

You can also just run `grunt` at any time to run the default Grunt task without using LiveReload.
